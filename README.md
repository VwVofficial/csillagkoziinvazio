# Csillagközi Invázió (空间侵略)

An intentionally hard game for a school project. The meaning of the title is
"Space invasion."

The project's language is hungarian, but for the repo I decided to use English.

## Building

The project uses `yarn`. `yarn build` builds the project into the `dist`
directory. `yarn dev` starts up a dev server.

## License

This project is available under the MIT license
